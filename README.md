# modelling-software-checklist


A checklist developed by Research Software Engineers in the Scottish Covid-19 Response Consortium and used to assess the software engineering aspects of "model readiness" for its six epidemiological models adapted/developed under the Royal Society's Rapid Assistance with Modelling the Pandemic (RAMP) scheme. This is intended to be part of a broader framework to evaluate and describe suitability of model results to be used in policy and decision making so this checklist covers only the software implementation and assumes that other documents cover questions about model validation, quality of science, data provenance and quality and policy readiness.

Only a few points within the checklist are specific to the work of the SCRC collaboration, or to epidemiology, so the checklist could be readily adopted to modelling or analysis software in other domains. We welcome dialogue and suggestions for improvement via Github issues on this repository.
